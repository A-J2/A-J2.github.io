        <h1>Step 1: Getting Your Car Ready for Export</h1>
        <p>At AutoTour Afrique, we make the car export process simple, starting with helping you get your vehicle ready to go. 
            We’ll walk you through gathering the important paperwork like the car’s title, bill of sale, and any necessary export permits. 
            Don’t worry, we’ll also make sure your vehicle meets the import regulations of the destination country, from emissions to safety standards. 
            We even advise you on cleaning the car (yep, it’s a thing!) to pass inspections. 
            Plus, we’ll help set up insurance to protect your car while it’s on its way.</p>
